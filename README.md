Calculator with physical constants

It is just a calculator with all the basic operations. It can also be used to convert numbers to other arithmetic bases and for solving arithmetic systems. The feature that makes it stand out is the saved mathematical and physical (primarily) constants that can be used in every operation. The graphics user interface allows you to add your own constants also and delete the ones you don't need any more.
